**DailyLog** is a note taking and task manager application combined. Use it to plan for the future and record the past so that every day you can be more present. Add floating tasks to your Inbox  📥 and when you want to accomplish them within the current week, migrate them to the weekly task list 📅. The Day view on the right provides a space where you can take any notes for a specific day.

### Why did I create this application? 🤔

I wanted to create an application that satisfied my needs for a note taking and task manager applicatoin combined. There are many options on the market that attempt to acheive this but I wanted to create one that fit my needs perfectly. In particular, I would like a history of how tasks are migrated between tiers of urgency (ie. moving a task from your Inbox, to your weekly task list, to your daily task list).
