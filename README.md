**DailyLog** is a note taking and task manager application combined. Use it to *plan for the future and record the past so that every day you can be more present*. Add floating tasks to your Inbox  📥 and when you want to accomplish them within the current week, migrate them to the weekly task list 📅. The Day view on the right provides a space where you can take any notes for a specific day.

### Why did I create this application?

I wanted to create an application that satisfied my needs for a note taking and task manager application combined. There are many options on the market that attempt to acheive this but I wanted to create one that fit my needs perfectly. In particular, I wanted a history of how tasks are migrated between tiers of urgency (ie. moving a task from your Inbox, to your weekly task list, to your daily task list). I believe having a history of this movement is good for mindfulness and self-improvement.
